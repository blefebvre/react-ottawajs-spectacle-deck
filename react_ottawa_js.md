React prez
----------

- demo
	- story about how the idea came about
		- not an expert, but wanted to share my thoughts after building something with React
	- show app on two devices (cross platform)
		- update app on one
		- have update appear on 2nd
- "on the shoulders of giants"
	- React
	- Firebase
	- React Router
	- React Intl
	- Cordova
	- Ionic Framework CSS
- we'll focus on React
- why react?
	- Fast
		- performance (virtual DOM)
		- to learn
	- Component based
		- "with React the only thing you do is build components"
		- "..present data that changes over time"
	- Simple
		- "express how your app should look at any given point in time"
	- No templates
		- means no abstractions. uses a real programming language to render views
		- markup unified with its corresponding view logic
- Components
	- a component should only do one thing
	- docs have a guide on breaking up your user interface [into a component heirarchy](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
